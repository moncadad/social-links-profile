## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing out of this worlds, but note worthy enough for me. I was having responsive issues with the profile card due to flex align centered and max-width combination the card stayed shrunken. This is what I did to make it the appropriate width based on the screen size.

```css
.card {
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 40px;
  width: 390px;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I had stepped away from the daily challenges, and learned some much needed JS. I haven't done any heavily JS focus challenges yet but I look forward to starting them.
